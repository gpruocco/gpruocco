- 👋 Hi, I’m @gpruocco
- 👀 I’m interested in initiating a COMSOL-based machine learning platform, able to access the potential of python in managing data.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning basic python structure. I'm an intermediate COMSOL user. I teach transport phenomena for a variety of bio-industrial applications.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on cancer proliferation and fight, having determined that mathematical models are really able to shape a better future for patients.
- 📫 How to reach me: an email to gianpaolo.ruocco@unibas.it would be fine.
